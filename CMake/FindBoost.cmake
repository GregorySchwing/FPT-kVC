# This module finds if Boost is installed and determines where the
# executables are. It sets the following variables:
#
#  BOOST_FOUND : boolean            - system has Boost
#  BOOST_LIBRARIES : list(filepath) - the libraries needed to use Boost
#  BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS : list(path)  - the Boost include directories
#
# If Boost is not found, this module downloads it according to the
# following variables:
#
#  BOOST_ROOT_DIR : path                - the Path where Boost will be installed on
#  BOOST_REQUESTED_VERSION : string     - the Boost version to be downloaded
#
# You can also specify its components:
#
#  find_package(Boost COMPONENTS program_options system)
#
# which are stored in Boost_FIND_COMPONENTS : list(string)
#
# You can also specify its behavior:
#
#  BOOST_USE_STATIC_LIBS : boolean (default: OFF)
